            <li><h2><i>Career Goal</i></h2></li>
            <p>My carrer goal is to become a computer engineer</p>
            <li><h2><i>Education</i></h2></li>
            <p>I am curently attending Palm Desert High School and have
            been for the past two years. PDHS is located in Palm
            Desert, CA. I have been taking required courses, but some
            classes that I have taken and others have not are Photography
            and computer sciences. Some colleges I am interested in are
            Harvard, San Diego University, and Stanford University. I
            would like to study robotics, computer engineering, and more
            computer science classes.</P>
            <li><h2><i>Work/Volunteer Experience</i></h2></li>
            <p>I worked on a project in my Freshman year on cyber bullying
             to raise awareness. I also trained my dog to listen to
             us and how to make her behave, so I know how to train puppies
             basic tricks and manners.</p>
