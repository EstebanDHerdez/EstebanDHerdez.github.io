                    in the future, there will be a lot of advancements on technology. With all these advancements, I want
                    to be prepared to be able to understand and use them. The way I am going to achieve my goal is to 
                    continue and finish the computer sciences class I am in right now. After that, I will continue these 
                    types of studies in college until I fully understand it. Lastly, I will use my knowledge from 
                    everything I have learned and use that to get a job with computer sciences and/or engineering. <hr>
