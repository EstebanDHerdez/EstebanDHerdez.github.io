                in the future, there will be a lot of advancements on technology. With all these advancements, I want
                to be prepared to be able to understand and use them. The way I am going to achieve my goal is to
                continue and finish the computer sciences class I am in right now. After that, I will continue these
                types of studies in college until I fully understand it. Lastly, I will use my knowledge from
                everything I have learned and use that to get a job with computer sciences and/or engineering.</p>
                <p>I do not have many skills relating to my career goal, but I plan to take more classes on
                computer sciences in order to make those skills. One "skill" I have is knowing how to use most
                computers. Also, being able to change the way I use a device, like switching the type of computer.
                For example, switching from android to Apple means you'll have to change the way you use and
                operate that device.</p>I have made a few accomplishements in high school. One major
                accomplishement I achieved was getting an average score of about 90% on all my finals last
                year. A primary reason for this is that I took Honors for all my important classes, other than
                Spanish. Having Honors classes helped because it made me work harder and it made me work more
                than other classes. A second major accomplishment I got was <p></td>
