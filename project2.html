We fixed this problem by moving the if statement for the “Ouch!” to be printed after the road. A second difficulty our group faced was making a full 70 equal signs (“=”) appear for the road, because only 69 equal signs were actually appearing. The way we fixed this was by making the “for i in range(70)” into “for i in range(71).” I think this fixed it because i starts at 0 instead of 1. A part of the program that I did independently was the function for calculating how much the hare moves.</p>
